A subsequent \u201crelief measure\u201d lottery was held in August.

The organising committee has approved 30 \u201cLive Site\u201d venues across Japan for non-ticketholders, including in areas affected by the Tohoku and Kumamoto earthquakes. These sites will feature live televised sports broadcasts, cultural events and among other programs, attendees will have the chance to try out various Olympic and Paralympic sports.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIs it true that I won\u2019t be allowed to post photos of events to social media?\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EShortly after the first round of tickets went on sale in Japan, controversy arose over certain aspects of the terms and conditions attached to the purchase of tickets, namely, the transfer of intellectual property rights of photos taken by attendees at Olympic events to the organising committee. Would this mean then that the committee \u2014 notorious for protecting its IP rights \u2014 would then crack down on social media photos?\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOrganisers have clarified that, while the committee is in fact claiming copyright over photos taken by ticket holders, it will not prevent those photos from being posted to social media. Only commercial reproduction of photos will be disallowed. Controversially, however, audio and video clips taken by spectators are not permitted to be posted on social media. Organisers are expected to be vigilant in filing takedown notices with social media networks.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the best way to access the venues each day?\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EUnsurprisingly, Tokyo\u2019s extensive public transit system will be key in shuttling attendees to and from venues each day. Even with companies embracing remote work during the games, to help ease Tokyo\u2019s famously packed trains, the influx of tourists is nonetheless expected to tax the system. Regardless, using Tokyo\u2019s rail and subway networks is everyone\u2019s best bet for reaching the venues.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFor a cheery twist, JR East and Pasmo (Tokyo Metro) in September began offering special contactless fare cards featuring colorful designs and characters for overseas guests.

Help!\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, helpful tools are available to assist navigating the byzantine scheduling and routing of Tokyo\u2019s trains. Hyperdia has long been the go-to website for expats in Japan for searching out train routes \u2014 simply enter the originating and destination stations, desired departure or arrival time and Hyperdia will provide up to 10 routes, which can be ranked by trip length, number of transfers required, or price.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAbove all, it is important to trust the information provided. Hopping on an earlier local train can add significant time to one\u2019s commute, while taking a rapid train may mean passing through your desired station without stopping.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFor those looking to keep things simple, Tokyo\u2019s famed Yamanote Line with its famous green livery is a circular commuter line that hits all of the major stations in Tokyo. Whether one has Shibuya dreams or a craving for crepes in Harajuku, the Yamanote Line is an easy \u2014 though not necessarily the fastest \u2014 option to travel between major stations in the city.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI can\u2019t get over the price of the hotels! Good thing I can cram 10 people into a room, right?\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYes and no, but mostly no. Unsurprisingly, hotels in and around Tokyo will feature some eye-popping prices. Already, \u201ccapsule\u201d hotels that normally run around US$20 (S$27.70) per night are advertising prices exceeding US$100.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is certainly temptation to split the cost of a single room across multiple guests, but it may not work. First, Japan\u2019s notoriously small (by Western standards) hotel rooms would be extremely cramped quarters for three or four people.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe real problem, however, comes with Japanese law and hotel practices. Unlike many destinations, Japanese hotels charge on a per-person, per-night rate, not simply by the room. If you reserve a double room for one adult, but show up to check-in with a travel companion, be prepared to pay up for the additional guest. Further, to comply with safety regulations, hotel rooms are limited by type in the number of guests they may have \u2014 a room rated as \u201csingle\u201d occupancy can only have a single adult, and so on.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHotels \u2014 particularly those three-stars and below, and especially spartan \u201cbusiness\u201d hotels \u2014 are sticklers for these rules and practice strict access control \u2014 some chains require guests to leave their key at the front desk when leaving the property, and most have their front desks facing the entrance and elevators to monitor those entering. While high-end Western hotel properties are less fastidious about access control, visitors to Japan should be aware of occupancy restrictions at most hotels in the country.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are my other options?\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter a rocky regulatory start, Airbnb stays in Japan have taken off to help meet the country\u2019s current tourism boom. Bookings are going fast, however, and those that remain are priced at a premium.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ETo combat the anticipated hotel room shortfall, cruise ships are also expected to be pressed into service to serve as floating hotels.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPlans fell through? Couldn\u2019t find a hotel room for some nights?\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are some last-ditch options available for visitors to Japan. There are 24-hour internet cafes, which offer cheap, comfortable \u2014 if cramped \u2014 overnight packages on a walk-in basis.

While more expensive than an internet cafe, love hotels provide a safe, comfortable place to stay if one\u2019s regular hotel reservation falls through.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat are some meals that I absolutely must try without breaking the bank?\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether it be a stand-up izakaya, mom-and-pop restaurant or US$300-a-course sushi, it is almost impossible to go wrong when it comes to dining out in Japan.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, despite Tokyo\u2019s reputation as a notoriously expensive city, great meals do not necessarily need to cost an arm and a leg. Indeed, thanks to strict food safety and marketing laws, as well as high standards of Japanese consumers, even fast-service restaurants such as the ubiquitous chains Gusto, Saizeriya and Royal Host, offer fare of surprisingly high quality.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the best bang for the buck, head to Shinjukukappo Nakajima, or for ramen lovers, Nakiryu in Tokyo\u2019s Toshima district \u2014 Michelin-starred restaurants where lunch sets start at under US$10.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBesides the games I wasn\u2019t able to get tickets on a few days.

Tokyo\u2019s famed Sumida fireworks display at the end of July is normally a crowded affair, but for a roomier experience, head to Takasaki Fireworks Matsuri in nearby Gunma prefecture. Held on the first Saturday in August, the festival features elaborate dashi floats, live music and is capped off with an hourlong fireworks display, one of the largest in the region.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAs an added benefit, the festival has wide open fields from which the fireworks display can be viewed. Simply put down a tarp to reserve a viewing spot, walk back to the city center for the festivities and return later to enjoy the show.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the sports-minded, the famed national high school Koushien baseball tournament also runs from early to late August. With a ticket costing US$8 to US$20 and granting access to three to four games daily, fans can enjoy high-quality baseball in a packed stadium with the energy of a professional game. \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/09\/27\/travel\/the-tokyo-2020-olympics-what-you-need-to-know.html\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003ETHE NEW YORK TIMES\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n","author":[],"external_author":null,"tags":[{"name":"Tokyo","slug":"Tokyo","menu_id":"126541"},{"name":"Japan","slug":"Japan","menu_id":"122916"},{"name":"olympics","slug":"olympics","menu_id":"127421"},{"name":"2020 Olympic Games","slug":"2020 Olympic Games","menu_id":"143236"}],"photo_4_3_image":"https:\/\/www.todayonline.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/section_landing_feeds_image_style\/public\/photos\/43_images\/2019-06-13t112408z_1419946282_mt1afl105720898_rtrmadp_3_file-odd-spo.jpg?itok=C_yTh6LV","photo_4_3_image_alt":"","photo_4_3_image_thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.todayonline.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/new_app_thumb_style\/public\/photos\/43_images\/2019-06-13t112408z_1419946282_mt1afl105720898_rtrmadp_3_file-odd-spo.jpg?itok=Zk62gBzA","photo_author":"Reuters file photo","has_gallery":false,"video_thumbnail":"","has_video":false,"term_id":"143236","publication_date":"2019-10-06 08:00:01","updated_date":"2019-10-06 08:00:01","tags_page":false,"source":"New York Times"}},{"node":{"title":"National diver Jonathan Chan \u0027goes with the flow\u2019 and finds himself with a shot at Olympic glory","node_id":"5167171","node_url":"https:\/\/www.todayonline.com\/singapore\/how-national-diver-jonathan-chan-goes-flow-and-finds-himself-shot-olympic-glory","status":"Completed","short_title":"National diver Jonathan Chan \u0027goes with the flow\u2019 and finds himself with a shot at Olympic glory","abstract":"SINGAPORE \u2014 He may be the first Singaporean to qualify for the Tokyo Olympic Games next year, even the first Singaporean diver to ever qualify for the Olympics, but glory can wait.","show_abstract":"0","body":"\u003Cp\u003ESINGAPORE \u2014 He may be the first Singaporean to qualify for the Tokyo Olympic Games next year, even the first Singaporean diver to ever qualify for the Olympics, but glory can wait.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ENational diver Jonathan Chan, 22, has a bigger immediate concern: Getting gold for his Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT), which is coming up in about two weeks.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be \u201ca bit paiseh (embarrassing) if national athlete doesn\u2019t get gold\u201d, he quipped in an interview with TODAY on Tuesday (Sept 10).
